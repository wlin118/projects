# Beginner Cybersecurity Projects

Welcome to the first projects in my portfolio!

I’m a recent graduate from Arizona State University, currently beginning my journey toward a career in penetration testing. This repository includes my first hands-on cybersecurity tools built in Python.

## 🔧 Projects Included

### 1. Port Scanner
- Scans a specified range of ports on a given IP address.
- Identifies and prints out which ports are open.

### 2. Ping Sweep Script
- Accepts a target IP and subnet mask (e.g., `/24`).
- Pings each IP address in the subnet to detect active hosts.

## 🚀 Goals
These tools were built as part of my learning process in network scanning and enumeration — foundational skills for ethical hacking and penetration testing.

## 📝 Future Plans
I plan to expand this repo as I grow in my knowledge of:
- Scripting automation for security tasks
- Vulnerability scanning
- Exploit development
- CTF challenges
