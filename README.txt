Welcome to the first projects in my portfolio. 
Currently I am a recent graduate from Arizona State University, and have just started on my learning journey to become a pentester. 
These first few projects include a port scanner and ping sweep script.
The port scanner scans every port on a specified range and prints a message if the port is open. 
The ping sweep pings each ip address on a subnet given a target ip and its subnet mask
